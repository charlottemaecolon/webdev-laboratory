    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Chari & Lotte Cafe started with a dream â€” to create a cozy corner 
      where people could slow down, sip freshly brewed coffee, and share 
      warm conversations. Our founders, inspired by their love for 
      coffee culture and homemade treats, opened this cafÃ© with one 
      mission: to make everyone feel at home. 
    </p>
    <p>
      From the aroma of roasted beans to the sweetness of our pastries, 
      every detail is crafted with love. Whether youâ€™re here for your 
      morning espresso, a study session, or just to relax, youâ€™ll always 
      find a little piece of comfort at Chari & Lotte Cafe. ðŸŒ¸
